# Introduction {.unnumbered}

In this class we are going to look at the basic concepts behind modern day Data Science techniques for industrial image processing.
We will always try to not only discuss the theory but also use [Python](https://www.python.org/) to illustrate the content programmatically.

The plan for these notes is to cover not only the basics of modern methods for machine learning in image processing but also topics in the near vicinity like

1. data management, labeling and preprocessing
1. life-cycle management of models
1. machine learning operations (MLOps)
1. current and research topics

These notes are intended for engineering students and therefore the mathematical concepts will rarely include rigorous proofs.

::: {.callout-note}
The `sklearn` package has all the tools to perform a PCA, see [Link](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_pca_iris.html) for an example using the Iris dataset same as in the beginning of this section.

The following books cover large sections of the content and are a good read to get further into the topics:
