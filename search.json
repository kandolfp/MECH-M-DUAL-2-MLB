We will always try to not only discuss the theory but also use Python to illustrate the content programmatically.\nThe plan for this notes it to cover not only the basics of modern methods for machine learning in image processing but also topics in the near vicinity like\n\nData management, labeling and preprocessing\nLife-cycle management of models\nmachine learning operations (MLOps)\ncurrent and research topics\n\nThese notes are intended for engineering students and therefore the mathematical concepts will rarely include rigorous proofs.",
