::: {.content-visible unless-format="html"}
:::: {.callout-note}
To allow acceptable formatting for multiple output formats like _html_ or _pdf_ some figures are numbered differently.
Furthermore, the interactive content in _html_ that is produced for example with `plotly` content is static in _pdf_.

Furthermore, the numbering of some lists in the _pdf_ is not consistent with regards to the _html_.
