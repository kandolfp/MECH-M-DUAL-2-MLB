# Summary {.unnumbered}

This concludes our introduction to machine learning in the context of images. 
The field of grid bases machine learning is vast and always developing.
With this in mind, these notes provide a strong foundation for addressing many challenges in industrial image processing using machine learning tools. 
By illustrating the concepts with well established examples and directly in Python code we hope to give a sound basis for developing new concepts and workflows.

In summary, if none of the methods and tools we've discussed here help solve the problem at hand, it indicates that we've encountered a challenge worth deeper investigation â€” perhaps even an opportunity for innovation, where domain expertise and machine learning can come together to create new solutions.
